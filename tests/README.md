# Rewrite-helper tests

# Running unit tests
1. Run AdGuardHome vm 
2. Run DummyHost vm
3. Ensure if ip address of vm is correct (see [Notes about virtual machines](#Notesaboutvirtualmachines) )
4. Type following command
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -t .
```
4. Goto [AdGuardHome vm](http://192.168.56.103/#dns_rewrites) webpage and check if there is no dns rewrite configured (excluding donot.delete)

Some test needs virtual machines or special files, please read [Test environment](#Testenvironment) and 
[Notes about virtual machines](#Notesaboutvirtualmachines) section before 
running test.  


# Test environment
To perform some test, extra steeps, such as setting file permissions, creating vm  must be taken. 

## Requirements
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- unittest

## Create environment automagically
1. Ensure if you are in test directory (rewrite-helper/tests).
2. Ensure you have VirtualBox installed
3. Run following commands, this script will create directories and attach vms
```bash
chmod +x ./create_test_env.sh
./create_test_env.sh
```
This script will prepare test files but virtual machines must be created manually
## Creating virtual machines
1. Prepare two virtual machines with [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), named "AdGuardHome", "DummyHost"
2. On DummyHost run following commands
```sh
apk update 
apk add apache2
/etc/init.d apache2 start
```
3. Change networks interfaces on VM's to host-only
4. Ensure if settings of your machines are the same as setting in [# Notes about virtual machines] section.
## Create environment manually
### Preparing environment for test: TestAnyYaml.test_no_permission()
Before run, ensure if there is a file named *config.yml* in directory *tests/unit/fixtures/config_files/any_yaml/no_permissions*.
This file must have 000 permission. This file is ignored by git (due to in insufficient permissions).

### Preparing environment for test: TestReadConfigFile.test_no_permission()
Before run, ensure if there is a file named *config.yml* in directory *tests/unit/fixtures/config_files/read_config_file/no_permissions*.
This file must have 000 permission. This file is ignored by git (due to in insufficient permissions).

### Preparing environment for test: TestReadConfigFile.test_file_is_a_directory()
Before run, ensure if directory test/unit/fixtures/config_files/read_config_file/a_directory exist, this directory should be empty.

# Notes about virtual machines
## AdGuardHome 
This vm runs AdGuardHome server
Machine Settings:
    IP address 192.168.56.103
    Web interface port 80  
    Username admin  
    Password 12345678
## DummyHost
This machine act's like a server for testing jobs
Machine Settings:
    IP address 192.168.56.105
