# Rewrite-helper tests

# Running unit tests
0. Please read [#Test environment] section before.
1. Run `AdGuardVM`
2. Run `DummyHost_1` vm
4. Type following command
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -t .
```
4. Goto [AdGuardHome vm](http://192.168.56.103/#dns_rewrites) webpage and check if there is no dns rewrite configured
   (excluding do-not.delete)

   
# Manual test
0. Please read [#Test environment] section before.
1. Run `AdGuardVM`, `DummyHost_1` and `DummyHost_2`
2. Check if dns-rewrite section is empty (excluding do-not.delete)
3. run program using (you must be in main program directory):
```bash
python3 ./main.py tests/manual/config.yml
```
4. Wait at least 2 minutes and check answers for domains `dummy.ping`, `dummy.http`, `single.http`, `single.ping`
all domains should answer with 192.168.56.105.
5. Save `DummyHost_1`.
6. Wait a minute.
7. Check if answers of domain, for `dummy.ping` and `dummy.http` are 192.168.56.107 and answers for domains `single.ping` 
and `single.http` is 192.168.56.107.
8. Run `DummyHost_1` again and wait at least 2 minutes
9. Check answers for domains `dummy.ping`, `dummy.http`, `single.http`, `single.ping` all domains should answer with 
192.168.56.105.
10. Check if answer for domain `static.lan` is 192.168.56.1.
11. Delete entry `static.lan` and wait at least 2 minutes.
12. Check if entry mentioned in point 9 was added again.
13. Relaunch rewrite-helper and check if there aren't duplicated domains.
14. Shutdown rewrite-helper.
15. Delete all dns rewrites.
16. Save all machines.

# Test environment
To perform some test, extra steeps, such as setting file permissions or creating vm  must be taken. 

## Requirements
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- unittest

## Setting up test files
Almost all test files are downloaded from GitHub, but some files need to be set manually.
1. Ensure if you are in test directory (rewrite-helper/tests).
2. Run following commands, this script will create files and set permissions
```bash
    ./test_env/create_test_env.sh
```


## Creating virtual machines
1. Prepare 3 virtual machines with [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) or other distro if you like ;)
2. On two of them install a web server for ex: apache2 (see `install_web_server.sh` in test_env directory), from now
these VMs will be called `DummyHost_1` and `DummyHost_2`
3. On third machine install AdGuardHome, this machine is called `AdGuardVM` from now.
4. Make sure that `DummyHost_1` has ip address: 192.168.56.105, `DummyHost_1` has ip address: 192.168.56.107,
`AdGuardVm` has ip address 192.168.56.103.
5. Also check if you can ping those machines and access their web interfaces
